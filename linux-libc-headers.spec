#
# This package has the headers for glibc.
# Although these come from the kernel, they are not kernel headers.
# These headers describe the kernel <-> userspace API/ABI for glibc use (only).
# As such, this package does not track the upstream kernel-of-the-day,
# and sticks to stable points of Linus releases.
#
# Usually we like to stick to LTS releases for these headers
#
# If you want to update this package, it needs a valid reason (like a new kernel
# API/ABI you want to use) and likely a glibc rebuild following updating this package
#

#
# If you have an out of tree driver that adds a userspace interface, we feel sorry
# for your pain, but this is not the place to add your unofficial permanent ABI.
# You will need to add a copy of your unofficial ABI to the package(s) that need
# to use this unofficial ABI, and those packages will need to be recompiled
# if the ABI changes as part of your upstreaming process.
